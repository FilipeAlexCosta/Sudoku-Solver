# Sudoku-Solver
Making a sudoku solver to learn the basics of C++.

The current version is a simple brute force using recursion.
Still needs more tests.
For now I think this is it, altough I may come back some day to try an iterative
solve using the log I made (even tough it will be pretty much the same).
